ABP stands for Authentication By Personalisation. It means that the encryption keys are configured manually on the device and can start sending frames to the Gateway without needing a 'handshake' procedure to exchange the keys (such as the one performed during an OTAA join procedure).

The example below attempts to get any data received after sending the frame. Keep in mind that the Gateway might not be sending any data back, therefore we make the socket non-blocking before attempting to receive, in order to prevent getting stuck waiting for a packet that will never arrive.

## EU868

```python

from network import LoRa
import socket
import ubinascii
import struct

# Initialise LoRa in LORAWAN mode.
# Please pick the region that matches where you are using the device:
# Asia = LoRa.AS923
# Australia = LoRa.AU915
# Europe = LoRa.EU868
# United States = LoRa.US915
lora = LoRa(mode=LoRa.LORAWAN, region=LoRa.EU868)

# create an ABP authentication params
dev_addr = struct.unpack(">l", ubinascii.unhexlify('00000005'))[0]
nwk_swkey = ubinascii.unhexlify('2B7E151628AED2A6ABF7158809CF4F3C')
app_swkey = ubinascii.unhexlify('2B7E151628AED2A6ABF7158809CF4F3C')

# join a network using ABP (Activation By Personalization)
lora.join(activation=LoRa.ABP, auth=(dev_addr, nwk_swkey, app_swkey))

# create a LoRa socket
s = socket.socket(socket.AF_LORA, socket.SOCK_RAW)

# set the LoRaWAN data rate
s.setsockopt(socket.SOL_LORA, socket.SO_DR, 5)

# make the socket blocking
# (waits for the data to be sent and for the 2 receive windows to expire)
s.setblocking(True)

# send some data
s.send(bytes([0x01, 0x02, 0x03]))

# make the socket non-blocking
# (because if there's no data received it will block forever...)
s.setblocking(False)

# get any data received (if any...)
data = s.recv(64)
print(data)
```

## US915

By default, the LoRa radio will transmit data on all 64 available channels. However, if you want to receive the packets with a [Pygate](/tutorials/expansionboards/pygate/), we need to specify which channels we can transmit on, as the Pygate only listens to 8 channels (Note that these channels are also most commonly listened to by other LoRa gateways). If you use the provided Pygate configuration file for US915, the example below will enable the correct transmit channels.

```python

from network import LoRa
import socket
import ubinascii
import struct
import time
# Initialise LoRa in LORAWAN mode.
# Please pick the region that matches where you are using the device:
# Asia = LoRa.AS923
# Australia = LoRa.AU915
# Europe = LoRa.EU868
# United States = LoRa.US915
lora = LoRa(mode=LoRa.LORAWAN, region=LoRa.US915)

print("joining")
# create an ABP authentication params
dev_addr = struct.unpack(">l", ubinascii.unhexlify('00000005'))[0]
nwk_swkey = ubinascii.unhexlify('2B7E151628AED2A6ABF7158809CF4F3C')
app_swkey = ubinascii.unhexlify('2B7E151628AED2A6ABF7158809CF4F3C')


#Do not transmit on the channels outside the Pygate scope
for i in range(0,64):
    lora.remove_channel(i)
    
lora.add_channel(0, frequency=903900000, dr_min=0, dr_max=3)
lora.add_channel(1, frequency=904100000, dr_min=0, dr_max=3)
lora.add_channel(2, frequency=904300000, dr_min=0, dr_max=3)
lora.add_channel(3, frequency=904500000, dr_min=0, dr_max=3)
lora.add_channel(4, frequency=904700000, dr_min=0, dr_max=3)
lora.add_channel(5, frequency=904900000, dr_min=0, dr_max=3)
lora.add_channel(6, frequency=905100000, dr_min=0, dr_max=3)
lora.add_channel(7, frequency=905300000, dr_min=0, dr_max=3)



# join a network using ABP (Activation By Personalization)
lora.join(activation=LoRa.ABP, auth=(dev_addr, nwk_swkey, app_swkey))

# create a LoRa socket
s = socket.socket(socket.AF_LORA, socket.SOCK_RAW)

# set the LoRaWAN data rate
s.setsockopt(socket.SOL_LORA, socket.SO_DR, 3)

# make the socket blocking
# (waits for the data to be sent and for the 2 receive windows to expire)
s.setblocking(True)

# send some data

>Note: Before using the Pysense, Pytrack or Pyscan board, check the [GitHub](https://github.com/pycom/pycom-libraries) for the latest version of the libraries.

Make a folder inside your project folder and call it `lib`. Then, copy the appropiate libraries from the github repository to the folder. Always copy the `pysense.py`, `pytrack.py` or `pyscan.py` *and* `pycoproc.py` files if you want to use the boards' functions

## Battery Charger

The Pygate features a single cell Li-Ion/Li-Po charger. When the board is being powered via the USB-C connector, the Pygate will charge the battery \(if connected\).

## Troubleshooting

* If PIC stays in bootloader mode, the [`dfu-util` update](/pytrackpysense/installation/firmware) should be performed

If you did not get started with our devices yet, please follow [this guide ](/gettingstarted/) first.

## Step 1: Create a Pybytes Account

If you already have a Forum or Webshop account, you can use the same credentials to log into [Pybytes](https://pybytes.pycom.io/)

Else, go to [Pybytes](https://pybytes.pycom.io) and create an account

## Step 2: Create a device 
1. Click on [Add Device](https://pybytes.pycom.io/devices). You can either add a device using USB, or the Pybytes App for [iPhone](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/pybytes/id1465696479) or [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=io.pycom.pybytes_android&hl=en). In this guide, we will describe the process using USB.

1. Select your network options. This will be how your device connects to both Pybytes and the internet. For now, choose WiFi. This will show a subwindow where you enter your WiFi credentials. This is only needed to connect your device with a WiFi network to access pybytes.

1. At the end of the *Add Device* wizard, Pybytes will show that your device profile was successfully created.

## Step 3: Provision your device

After creation, you will land on the provisioning page. This is where we 'inform' the device about the Pybytes connection and how to set it up. The first time you set up the device for use with Pybytes, you will need to provision it using the Firmware Updater Tool. This is a good moment to become familiar with the tool.


## Step 1: Go to the registration page

1. Go to [https://pybytes.pycom.io](https://pybytes.pycom.io/?utm_source=docs&utm_medium=web&utm_campaign=pybytes-getting-started).
2. Enter your full name, email address and set a password for your account.
3. Confirm the verification message sent to your email address.
4. Click on the link and complete your login.
